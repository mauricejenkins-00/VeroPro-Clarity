VeroPro-Clarity

VeroPro-Clarity is a digital discernment tool designed to help users make informed decisions about the apps and platforms they use. The app analyzes terms & conditions, privacy policies, and influence techniques to reveal how each app may impact users’ autonomy, attention, and well-being.

By translating legal jargon and identifying manipulative design patterns, VeroPro-Clarity empowers individuals to engage with technology more consciously.
